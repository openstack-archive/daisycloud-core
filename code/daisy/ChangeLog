* Reverts commit that did db migration during configure_db() and makes functional tests use in-memory database again. The issues we were seeing had to do with the timeout not being long enough when starting servers with disk-based registry databases and migrate taking too long when spinning up the registry server... this was shown in almost random failures of tests saying failure to start servers. Rather than increase the timeout from 3 seconds, I reverted the change that runs migrate on every startup and cut the total test duration down about 15 seconds

* Moving parallax models out of common and into the parallax module
* Updated tests
* Reimplements server.py as a wsgi api inheriting from glance.common
* This patch: * pulls in a number of useful libraries from Nova under the common/ path (we can factor those out to a shared library in Bexar-release) * Defines the models in common.db.sqlalchemy.models.py (this should be factored out into the parallax package soon) * Adds the parallax api-server under /bin (if PyPI was used to pull python-daemon and python-lockfile, you may need to apply a patch I have against it)
