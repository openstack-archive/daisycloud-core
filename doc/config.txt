Configuration Guide
===================

Before installing Daisy on jump server, you have to configure the
daisy.conf file, then put it in /home/daisy_install/.

1. you have to supplement the "daisy_management_ip" field with the ip of
   management ip of your Daisy server vm.

2. Now the backend field "default_backend_types" just support the "kolla".

3. "os_install_type" field just support "pxe" for now.

4. Daisy now use pxe server to install the os, so "build_pxe" must set to "yes".
   If the value in daisy.conf in your env of /home/daisy_install/ dir is "no",
   you must change this field to "yes" manually before installing Daisy.

5. "eth_name" field is the pxe server interface, and this field is required when
   the "build_pxe" field set to "yes".This should be set to the interface
   (in Daisy Server VM) which will be used for communicating with other target nodes
   on management/PXE net plane. Default is ens3.

6. "ip_address" field is the ip address of pxe server interface.

7. "net_mask" field is the netmask of pxe server, which is required when the "build_pxe"
   is set to "yes"

8. "client_ip_begin" and "client_ip_end" field are the dhcp range of the pxe server.

9. If you want to use the multicast type to deliver the kolla image to target node,
   set the "daisy_conf_mcast_enabled" field to "True"
